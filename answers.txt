Q 1.
The default authentication scheme uses HTTP Basic Authentication.
signed against a user's username and password. It is managed under setting.py where 
in REST_FRAMEWORK under 'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES' you set
'rest_framework.authentication.BasicAuthentication' in one of its parameters.

Q 2.

when using -a or --auth it uses the default authentication scheme
which requires a name and password.

Q 3.
Token based authentication requires the user to get and then provide 
a token from the server. The token is then used to authenticate between the server and user.


while 
Session authentication saves the session ID in a cookie on the browser and is sent on every 
request to the server while the server checks the Id and processes the request based on id. The
server also stores the state of the user session. It is very taxing for the server to save the session state
of every user.

The authentication of tokens are better because it is encrypted while basic authentication 
just sets the name and password into base 64 which is not good security and can easily be decoded.

Q 4.

WHen we try to login to bitbucket, bitbucket asks google for an authentication request for bitbucket to access 
our google information. Google asks us fro the credentials so We enter our credentials and google grans bitbucket an authorization grant.
Bit bucket then uses the authorization grant to get an access Token from google server.
THe access token can be used from bitbucket to  ask for resources from google.
